welkom to this simpel roblox morsecode translator

you know the chat restrictions that roblox made, and that peopel have found a way around it?

how? you ask? it is simpel, jump for . and move slithly for -

but not evryone knows morsecode so i desided to make this program.

the program has its how to use build in to it, so it will work like normal.

versons:
0.1: the bare bones alfa version, only has 1 setting with 1 opsion, nl, a .json file for storing settings (this part is already like 80 lines of code lol) and the output part without a stop.

  this version suports: program version 0.1, settings version 0.1 and version label version (so i can chanes the formating of that later without braking the code) 0.1
